# **数字识别**

## 比赛说明

* MNIST（"修改后的国家标准与技术研究所"）是计算机视觉的事实上的 "hello world" 数据集。自1999年发布以来，手写图像的经典数据集已成为基准分类算法的基础。随着新机器学习技术的出现，MNIST 仍然是研究人员和学习者的可靠资源。
* 在本次比赛中，您的目标是正确[识别数以万计手写图像的数字](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)。我们策划了一套教程式的内核，涵盖从回归到神经网络的一切。我们鼓励您尝试使用不同的算法来学习第一手什么是有效的，以及技术如何比较。

> 注意：[项目规范](/docs/kaggle-quickstart.md)

> 准备数据: 分离数据特征和目标变量，加载测试数据

```python
# 加载数据
def opencsv():
    # 使用 pandas 打开
    data = pd.read_csv('datasets/getting-started/digit-recognizer/input/train.csv')
    data1 = pd.read_csv('datasets/getting-started/digit-recognizer/input/test.csv')

    train_data = data.values[0:, 1:]  # 读入全部训练数据
    train_label = data.values[0:, 0]
    test_data = data1.values[0:, 0:]  # 测试全部测试个数据
    return train_data, train_label, test_data

trainData, trainLabel, testData = opencsv()
```

> 模型训练: 产生训练模型

```python
# 模型训练
def knnClassify(trainData, trainLabel):
    knnClf = KNeighborsClassifier()   # default:k = 5,defined by yourself:KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=10)
    knnClf.fit(trainData, ravel(trainLabel))
    return knnClf

knnClf = knnClassify(trainData, trainLabel)
```

> 模型评估: 用于评估结果的正确率和召回率

`暂时没写，后面会进行优化`

> 结果预测: 通过模型来预测新来数据的结果

```python
# 结果预测
testLabel = knnClf.predict(testData)
```

> 结果导出

```python
def saveResult(result, csvName):
    with open(csvName, 'wb') as myFile:
        myWriter = csv.writer(myFile)
        myWriter.writerow(["ImageId", "Label"])
        index = 0
        for i in result:
            tmp = []
            index = index+1
            tmp.append(index)
            # tmp.append(i)
            tmp.append(int(i))
            myWriter.writerow(tmp)

# 结果的输出
saveResult(testLabel, 'datasets/getting-started/digit-recognizer/ouput/Result_sklearn_knn.csv')
```
